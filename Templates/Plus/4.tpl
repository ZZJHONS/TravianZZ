<p class="f10 b">How do I get Gold?</p>
<p>Ask owner of the site</p>


<p class="f10 b">Why can't I finish some buildings with Gold?</p>

<p>Due to game play reasons the buildings Residence and Palace are excluded from this function. The same applies to villages in which the wonders of the world can be constructed. </p>

<p class="f10 b">I activated the Plus account, however, my resource production did not increase.</p>
<p>The production did not increase because Plus is separated from these additional features. </p>

<p class="f10 b">Do I need to activate Plus before I can use any other function?</p>
<p>No, you can use every single gold feature as long as you have enough gold. </p>
